For children aged 4-8, finding popular characters in the public domain can be a bit more challenging, as many well-known characters are protected by copyright. However, there are still several beloved characters and stories that are in the public domain and can be freely used in your projects. Here are some popular public domain characters that resonate with this age group:

### 1. **Fairy Tale Characters**
   - **Hansel and Gretel** (Brothers Grimm)
   - **Little Red Riding Hood** (Brothers Grimm)
   - **Rumpelstiltskin** (Brothers Grimm)

### Key Points:
- **Versions Matter:** While these characters and stories are in the public domain, specific versions or adaptations (like Disney's versions of many fairy tales) are not. When using these characters, it’s essential to create your own version or interpretation to avoid infringing on copyrighted adaptations.
  
- **Creative Freedom:** Because these characters are in the public domain, you have the creative freedom to adapt and modernize them to suit contemporary audiences, making them more engaging for today’s children.

These characters and stories have stood the test of time and continue to be popular with young audiences. They offer a great starting point for creating content that is both familiar and legally safe to use.
